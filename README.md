# GeoGWAS

Leveraging geometric techniques and graph neural networks to uncover meaningful biology from GWAS data.

## FinnGen Project

### Overview 
- The **FinnGen research project** is a significant journey exploring genomics and medicine, involving 500,000 biomedical pioneers from Finland.
- It is a collaborative effort uniting a nationwide network of Finnish biobanks. Every Finnish citizen can participate by providing biobank consent.
- The project has currently amassed 589,000 samples, with an objective to gather 520,000 by 2023. The latest data accumulation included combined genotype and health registry data from 473,681 individuals.
- The research project harnesses samples from a nationwide network of Finnish biobanks, merging genome information with digital health care data from national health registries.
- Samples are collected from all parts of Finland, with a focus on discovering solutions in personalized healthcare by examining large populations. 
- The genome data, owned by the Finnish biobanks, remain available for research purposes. The medical breakthroughs that occur from the project are expected to globally benefit healthcare systems and patients.
- The **FinnGen research project** is a joint venture involving all the stakeholders of drug development, aimed at accelerating the emergence of new medical innovations.
- The latest data, data freeze 9, includes results and summary statistics from over 377,200 individuals, almost 20.2 M variants, and 2,272 disease endpoints. The results and summary statistics can be explored using the FinnGen web browser and downloaded.
- The University of Helsinki is responsible for the study, with the nationwide network of Finnish biobanks participating in the study, thus covering the entirety of Finland. The Helsinki Biobank coordinates the sample collection.
